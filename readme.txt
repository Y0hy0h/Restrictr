Restrict access to pages and posts by hiding them from visitors and redirecting them.

== Description ==

Access to any page or post on your website can be controlled with this plugin.
You can block users from accessing a page or post by activating redirection. They will instead only
see the page you specified in the settings.
If you want to want to hide a page or post from all menues and lists, you can activate hiding.
Users can still access those pages and posts through direct links, unless you also activated
redirection.

The plugin allows for its functionality to only be active when a certain condition is met.
This means that you can only hide and redirect posts and pages for logged in users.
